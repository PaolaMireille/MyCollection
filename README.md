# MyCollection
1.	Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.
The website i created is very simple with a straight forward structure. First of all, i created all the required html pages plus the css style sheet. The elements that worked well on the site is navigation. The users are able to browse through the pages on the site. Another aspect was the images; on the collection page i managed to put together a few images from my trip to portugal. I Also managed to create a contact fom for users.

What went wrong:
I had troubles using github and trying to make my website live. When entering the url the site is not found.

2.	Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.
I haven't collaboraed or discussed with anyone on or about this assignment.
